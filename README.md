# Sales-Summary-Dashboards
In this project I took a sample dataset and loaded it with Excel. I made sure to remove all duplicates and look for any incorrect formatting. After that I removed columns that I felt unneccesary for analysis. Then I made Pivot Table that I could use for KPIs and to create tables and graphs for the Dashboard. Once all Pivot Tables were completed. I formatted my own Dashboard highlighting some key sales metrics, looking at top customers, and allowing user to filter by things like Year, Region, and Item Category.
